# Hotels_price_prediction

excited to share the completion of our Hotels Price Prediction Project!

üîç Project Overview:
In this project, we tackled the Hotels Price Prediction problem using machine learning techniques, particularly focusing on the Linear Regression algorithm. Our goal was to predict hotel prices based on various features such as Star rating, rating, Free Parking, Fitness Center, Airport Shuttle, etc.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology:
We began by thoroughly exploring and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Next, we engineered new features and carefully selected relevant ones to enhance model performance. Leveraging the power of Linear Regression, we developed a model to predict the target variable based on the input features. This approach allowed us to understand the linear relationships within the data and make accurate predictions.

üìä Results:
After rigorous experimentation and fine-tuning of hyperparameters, our Linear Regression model demonstrated impressive performance with an accuracy of on the test dataset. Furthermore, we conducted a feature importance analysis.


üöÄ Key Takeaways:
This project provided invaluable hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, showcasing the effectiveness of Linear Regression in tackling real-world Regression tasks. It underscores the importance of leveraging ensemble methods to achieve robust predictive performance in complex datasets.

I invite you to explore our GitHub repository to delve deeper into the project details and codebase. Feel free to reach out for any inquiries or discussions regarding our approach and findings. Let's continue advancing the frontier of data science together!
